    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <br/>

    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <br/>
    <p>Hello! My name is Daniel. I am a reformed creative person who is now seeking a future as a reborn techy person. I jumped headfirst into this bootcamp thing after talking it over with some techy friends. I also discussed this path with a non-techy friend - my dog Mellow (we are bff).</p>

    <h2>Education History</h2>
    <br/>
    <p>I have a 4 year English degree from UW.</p> 
    <br/>
    <p>It took me 7 years to finish. :| </p>
    <br/>

    <h2>Job Experience</h2>
    <br/>
    <p>I parlayed my English degree into an SEO job. From there I weaseled my way into an SEM position. Then I escaped into selling digital ads for awhile. Soon enough I needed an escape from the escape so I got a job in email marketing somehow. And after acquainting myself with the web team across the hall, I tricked them into hiring me as a web producer.</p>
<br/>
    <p>At each step along the way, I basically lied to get the job. And then Googled like mad to learn the job after the fact. So I'm no stranger to using Google to help learn what I'm doing as I'm doing it. </p>
<br/>
    <h2>Goals!</h2>
    <br/>
    <ul>
        <li>Learn to code</li>
        <li>Meet some code folks</li>
        <li>Make some cool projects</li>
        <li>Show those projects to prospective employers</li>
        <li>Get a cool job and live happily ever after...?</li>
    </ul>
